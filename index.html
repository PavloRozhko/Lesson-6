        <p class="info-text">Successful leg mass building relies on a 4-point rule. First, you must start the workout with the most strenuous exercises and the heaviest weights. Second, you have to hit the thighs from different angles. Third and fourth, you need to keep every routine's volume high and train at least some of the movements to muscle failure.</p>

        <h2 class="main-title">Leg Workout Exercises</h2>
        <div id="exercise-1">
          <h3 class="exercise-title title">1. Barbell Squat</h3>
          <div class="exercise-img">
            <img src="img/ex1.jpg" alt="Barbell Squat picture">
          </div>
          <p class="exercise-text text-big">(4 sets, 6-10 reps)</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Make a hip-width stance with your toes facing slightly outward. Support the barbell on the top of your trap muscles, chest up, and head facing forward.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Bend your knees slowly, while driving them outward and keeping your back straightened. Hinge your hips and your knees will move forward. Make sure the bar moves in a straight line up and down.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Slowly keep the weight on your heels and push up to go back to your initial position.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exercise-2">
          <h3 class="exercise-title title">2. Hip Thrust</h3>
          <div class="exercise-img"><img src="img/ex2.jpg" alt="Hip Thrust picture"></div>
          <p class="exercise-text text-big">(4 sets of 8-12 reps)</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Lie with your upper back supported on a bench, and your feet planted firmly on the floor. Hold a barbell across your hips. Slowly lower your hips down to the floor. Only low enough that your glutes and hamstrings remain in constant tension. Power back up while pressing through your heels and squeezing your glutes at the top.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exercise-3">
          <h3 class="exercise-title title">3. Weighted Walking Lunge</h3>
          <div class="exercise-img"><img src="img/ex3.jpg" alt="Weighted Walking Lunge picture"></div>
          <p class="exercise-text text-big">(3 sets 10-14 reps per side)</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Begin with a hip-width stance holding a dumbbell in each hand.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Put one leg forward, bending your knees to lower your hips. Dip until your back knee nearly meets the floor. Keep an upright posture, and avoid moving your front knee past your toes to avoid injury.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Put your weight on your front foot's heel and ascend from the lunge. Switch sides and repeat.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">As you exhale, extend your legs fully using your quads. Keep your back flat on the padded seat during the movement. Pause and squeeze for a moment and then slowly retreat to your original position.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Repeat until you finish the set.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exercise-4">
          <h3 class="exercise-title title">4. Lying Leg Curls</h3>
          <div class="exercise-img"><img src="img/ex4.jpg" alt="Lying Leg Curls picture"></div>
          <p class="exercise-text text-big">(3 sets, 8-12 reps)</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Lie face down on the machine and place your feet under the foot pad — a few inches below the calves. Grab the machine's handle, keep your torso flat, and stretch your legs fully.</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">Keeping your upper legs on the pad, curl your legs as far as you can while you exhale. Pause for a second after fully curling your legs. Go back to the original position as you inhale.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="exercise-5">
          <h3 class="exercise-title title">5. Calf Raises</h3>
          <div class="exercise-img"><img src="img/ex5.jpg" alt="Calf Raises picture"></div>
          <p class="exercise-text text-big">(4 sets, 15-20 reps)</p>
          <p class="exercise-text">You can do these seated or standing. Plant the balls of your feet firmly on the step with your heels extending over the edge. As you exhale, raise your heels as high as you can, feeling your calves flex. Pause for a second and lower your heels to return to your initial position.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="main-text">To make the most out of this leg day workout routine — choose loads that let you hit muscle failure within the repetitions you set. If you want to cut the workout short, you can leave out the hamstrings or calves exercises (or both) and train them on another day.</p>
